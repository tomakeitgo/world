The goal of this blog is to start start recording my learning in one place. A place to practice writing and building software.

The immediate target is to start figuring out how to use "the cloud". It looks like it is here to stay for awhile. The first part of this journey will be getting some static hosting up and running.

The cloud provider I will be picking is AWS. I will be attempting to make everything scriptable and repeatable. An attempt will be made to avoid using clickops to make it go. As much as possible allocating AWS things should be done using some sort of configuration or programming language. 

If you dear reader have found this post. It means that this decent into madness has escaped my local computer and network.

Thank you for reading.
