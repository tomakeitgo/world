In the last entry, I set up a lifecycle policy on my deployment S3 bucket.
It didn't work. The problem was my understanding of the prefix setting. I assumed
that the Prefix attribute was required and that it was glob like syntax. Both of these
ideas are wrong.

I wanted the following yaml to keep 3 old versions of my deployment file. It didn't delete anything.

```yaml
  # More Definitions above 
  LifecycleConfiguration:
    Rules:
      - Id: DeleteOldVersions
        Prefix: "*"
        Status: Enabled
        NoncurrentVersionExpiration:
          NoncurrentDays: 1
          NewerNoncurrentVersions: 3
```

The version that works how I wanted looks like:

```yaml
  LifecycleConfiguration:
    Rules:
      - Id: DeleteOldVersions
        Status: Enabled
        NoncurrentVersionExpiration:
          NoncurrentDays: 1
          NewerNoncurrentVersions: 3
```

The prefix is simpler than I thought. It is a strict prefix match.
The first definition was looking for objects in the bucket that started with an '*'.
Prefix isn't required and a policy without it or the other conditions applies to the whole bucket.

It took a couple of days to figure out what was going on. S3 lifecycle policies take about a day to do their thing. As best as I could find
they get applied once a day. So mistakes have at least a day to become visible.

### Moving Forward
I have added logic for creating solar bodies (Star, Planet, and Dwarf Planet).  My next step is to figure out how to get a ship 
that spirals out into the universe creating solar systems. The universe is mostly empty and starting to fill it seems the next move.
